Unique Tabs
===========

(A Chromium Extension)
--------------------

Every time you open a new tab or navigate to a new page, this extension automatically checks for duplicates in the same window.

It'll switch to the original tab and close the new one then (A notification is displayed in Chrome. Clicking this notification will reopen it)


Installation

Click _version history_ in here to find the newest build by me.
